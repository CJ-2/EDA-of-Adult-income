# EDA-of-Adult-income
Exploratory data analysis of adult income using pandas.

dataset description:
An individual’s annual income results from various factors. Intuitively, it is influenced by the individual’s education level, age, gender, occupation, and etc.

This is a widely cited KNN dataset. I encountered it during my course, and I wish to share it here because it is a good starter example for data pre-processing and machine learning practices.

Fields
The dataset contains 16 columns
Target filed: Income
-- The income is divide into two classes: <=50K and >50K
Number of attributes: 14
-- These are the demographics and other features to describe a person

We can explore the possibility in predicting income level based on the individual’s personal information.
